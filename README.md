# Lockbox-Timer

> ** this project is WIP!!!**

A box out of wood that is locked via a servo motor. One can set a Timer (e.g. 1 hour 30 minutes). Then the box gets locked and via a servo motor and the countdown begins. When time is over the box opens again. 

Background: 
I wanted a place where I can put my smartphone during studying, so that I can only reach it again when I finished my learning session.
